Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles , methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high qality software systems.
Its importance is it enables the creation of reliable, scalable and innovative software solutions that meet the user's need.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages such as C
2. The establishment of software enginnering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The advent of structured programming in 1970s.
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements -Its the process of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - it's the process of creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation - writing codes and building the software according to the software's specifications
4. Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment - releasing the software to users
6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases such as requirements, design, implementation whereas agile is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer is reponsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. A quality assuarance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. A project manager oversees the planning, exection, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code such as Visual Studio
VCS are software tools used for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members such as Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight deadlines which lead to pressure to deliver the software products resulting in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
The strategies to overcome these challenges are effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassments of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration testing includes testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing involes testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It is important in that it helps avoid getting a confusing answer by making the questions clear and specific, so that AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - "How many lakes are there?"
Clear prompt - "How many lakes are there in Kenya?"
